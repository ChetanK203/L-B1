            A Network is nothing but a connection made through connection links between two or more 
            devices. Devices can be a computer, printer or any other device that is capable to send and 
            receive data. There are two ways to connect the devices :
            1. Point-to-Point connection 
            2. Multipoint connection
            Point-To-Point Connection
            It is a protocol which is used as a communication link between two devices. It is simple to 
            establish. The most common example for Point-to-Point connection (PPP) is a computer 
            connected by telephone line. We can connect the two devices by means of a pair of wires or 
            using a microwave or satellite link.<br>
